# ChatGPT Desktop App

This is a sample/playground project, toying around with the idea of a native Windows 11 app for ChatGPT (which spawned from a Twitter post where a guy posted mockup screenshots of the concept he designed: https://x.com/Devoid_5/status/1989797164508483785?s=20).

Built using WinUI 3, .NET 10, and WinAppSDK 1.8+ while targeting a minimum OS build of Windows 11 (10.0.22000.0).

## Project State

It's important to note that I just whipped this up as quickly as possible, this is the first build. It **IS** in a functional state for developers but it is **NOT** in a functional state for regular users, meaning, the solution builds perfectly fine with no errors nor warnings, but the actual OpenAI ChatGPT API/SDK integration has not been completed (it hasn't even been started) yet, so please don't expect to download the app and be able to start having conversations with ChatGPT right now. I've put all of 30 minutes into this (so far).
